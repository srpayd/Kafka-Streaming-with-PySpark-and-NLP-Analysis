# Streaming Data Pipeline - Kafka
I implemented Spark Streaming with Python to process continuously generated logs in real-time, displaying the results in the producer console. In this setup, all log files are directed to a Kafka server under the "deneme2" topic. You can find my solution and detailed documentation in the "KafkaWordCount.ipynb" script file.

Please feel free to access the comprehensive documentation for a more in-depth understanding of my approach. Thank you for your interest!
