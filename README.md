# kafka
I have applied Spark Streaming with Python to compute continuously generated logs have to be shown in the producer console as real time. I assume that all log files come to one Kafka server under "deneme2" topic. From here my solution is included in the "KafkaWordCount.ipynb" script file. 

Please also access attached "Documentation.docx" file (download by clicking on Raw View) to observe my approach in more detail.

Thanks.
