# kafka
I have applied Spark Streaming with Python to compute continuously generated logs in a real time. My solution is included in the KafkaWordCount.py script file. 

Please also access attached "Documentation.docx" file (download by clicking on Raw View) to observe my approach in more detail.

Thanks.
